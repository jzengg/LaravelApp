Your test (should you choose to continue the conversation) is to try to build the following simple app.

(1) Please build an app with a login page where users can login and then do something (using Laravel and Eloquent as your MVC and ORM frameworks).

https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-5-fundamentals site has great Laravel tutorials.

It doesn't have to be 20 models or controllers -  2-3 will do just fine as long as the code is tested / documented/ we can run it (so dependencies are clearly defined and well explained).

We are into testing here, so phpunit or phptest would work.

(2)  Once you build this simple app , add the following functionality - only allow users to login from one browser at a time.

In other words, if users are logged in in Safari, and then open a Firefox browser and login into the app, Safari app should log them out.  Likewise, if users then try to login again into Safari, Firefox app should kick them out.

Once you have something, upload it to your github and give us access to clone the repo and comment on it.  We'll continue the conversation then.

Let me know if it works, feel free to reach out with more questions.
